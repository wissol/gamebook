<h2>Section Title</h2>
<p>Section text, this is a paragraph. And I think it is kinda important
to write something. Let's introduce the situation to the player-reader,
let's explain the options available, trying to be be fair but still not
too easy to the player. I think about 5 lines should be the minimum, for
most purposes. No need for "linking" sections on a gamebook engine as 
this should be done by the computer, not the reader.</p>
